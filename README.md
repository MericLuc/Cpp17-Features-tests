This repository contains a list of **small tests** regarding enhancements brought by the **_c++17 standard_**.

Note : Well, some of them do not really have to do with C++17 but seemed nice to incorporate here.

Here is the list of the concepts that I have tested :
- [**Copy ellision**](copy-ellision.cpp)
- [**Chain evaluation order**](chain-evaluation-order.cpp)
- [**Remove an element in a std::vector in O(1) Timme**](fast-remove-in-vectors.cpp)
- [**Limit variables scope to if/else/switch statements**](init-in-selection.cpp)
